The purpose of this project is to create a website for a charity that supports local children in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

A user would want to use our website to combine their vacation or retirement in Puerto Vallarta with giving back to the community. They would benefit by making a positive difference in the lives of the children they support. The user would visit our website because currently the charity doesn't have a website.

## Stories

- As a user, I want to easily understand what the charity vision is.
- As a user, I want to find out how I can contribute.
- As a developer, I want to keep my program DRY and limit the amount of lines of code.
- As a developer, I want to use bootstrap to make my website responsive and more pleasing to the eye.
